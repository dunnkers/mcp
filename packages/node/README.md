`hevy-mcp` is an open-source [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
server for the [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/) fitness and workout tracking
app. It lets AI assistants read, analyze, create, and update your Hevy workouts,
routines, exercise templates, and body measurements through authenticated Hevy
API requests.

> A Hevy API key, available with **Hevy PRO**, is required.

## See it in action

[![Hevy MCP demo showing an AI assistant analyzing six weeks of Hevy training data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/main/docs/assets/hevy-mcp-demo.gif)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/main/docs/assets/hevy-mcp-demo.mp4)

<p align="center"><sub>Click the preview to play the full-quality 18-second demo.</sub></p>

In the demo, the assistant retrieves real Hevy data and answers a multi-part
training question with evidence from the user's workout history.

## What can you do with it?

- **Analyze training progress:** summarize 1-12 weeks of workouts and body
  measurements in one tool call.
- **Ask questions in plain language:** find recent sessions, frequently trained
  exercises, consistency gaps, routine details, or exercise history.
- **Plan and log training:** create or update workouts, routines, routine folders,
  custom exercises, and body measurements.
- **Search without huge responses:** discover routines and exercise templates with
  compact, AI-friendly results.
- **Connect from your preferred MCP client:** use the hosted Streamable HTTP
  endpoint or run locally with Codex, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other clients.
- **Start without installing anything:** connect directly to the production
  Cloudflare Worker—no Node.js, package download, or Docker container required.
- **Keep local control when you want it:** run the same server with `npx`, `bunx`,
  or the official Docker image.

Try asking:

> Analyze my training over the last six weeks. Show workouts per week, my most
> frequently trained exercises, any obvious gaps or inconsistencies, and cite the
> workout evidence you used.

> Find my push-day routine and show its exercises and sets.

> Compare my recent body measurements with my training consistency.

> Create a completed workout from my saved routine. Ask me for any missing set
> results before writing it to Hevy.

## Quick start

### 1. Get your Hevy API key

Create an API key in [Hevy's API settings](https://www.hevyapp.com/api), then
keep it somewhere secure. API access currently requires a Hevy PRO subscription.

### 2. Connect `hevy-mcp` to your client

The hosted Cloudflare endpoint is the fastest way to start. It runs remotely,
so your client does not need Node.js, Bun, Docker, or a local server process.

#### Connect to the hosted endpoint

Production URL:

```text
https://mcp.hevy-mcp.dev/mcp
```

The endpoint uses Streamable HTTP. Send your Hevy API key as a bearer token on
every request.

##### Codex

Codex CLI, the Codex desktop app, and the IDE extension share the same MCP
configuration. Make your Hevy API key available in the environment that starts
Codex, then add the hosted server:

```bash
export HEVY_API_KEY=your-hevy-api-key
codex mcp add hevy \
  --url https://mcp.hevy-mcp.dev/mcp \
  --bearer-token-env-var HEVY_API_KEY
```

Codex stores the environment variable name, not the key itself, in its MCP
configuration. Restart Codex or begin a new session, then run `codex mcp list`
to verify the server is configured.

##### Other Streamable HTTP clients

Clients that accept a remote MCP URL and fixed headers commonly use this shape:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"hevy": {
			"url": "https://mcp.hevy-mcp.dev/mcp",
			"headers": {
				"Authorization": "Bearer your-hevy-api-key"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Exact configuration keys vary by client. The hosted server requires support for
Streamable HTTP and a fixed `Authorization` header.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Treat the bearer value like a password. The Worker validates it with Hevy for
> each request, does not store it, and forwards it to Hevy only as the required
> `api-key` header.

#### Run locally instead

Choose local stdio if you prefer to run the server on your own machine or your
client cannot attach a fixed authorization header to remote MCP requests.

##### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add hevy \
  --env HEVY_API_KEY=your-hevy-api-key \
  -- npx -y hevy-mcp
```

##### Claude Desktop or Cursor

Add this `mcpServers` entry to your client configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"hevy": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "hevy-mcp"],
			"env": {
				"HEVY_API_KEY": "your-hevy-api-key"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Common local configuration locations:

- **Claude Desktop on macOS:**
  `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Claude Desktop on Windows:**
  `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Cursor:** `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

Restart or reconnect the client after saving the file.

##### Any stdio MCP client

Configure your client to launch this command with `HEVY_API_KEY` in the child
process environment:

```bash
npx -y hevy-mcp
```

`npx` requires Node.js 20 or newer. Restart or reconnect your client after
saving its configuration.

### Programmatic API

The package exposes two named functions for applications that embed the MCP
server:

```ts
import { createNodeMcpServer, runStdioServer } from "hevy-mcp";

const server = await createNodeMcpServer({ apiKey: process.env.HEVY_API_KEY! });
// Connect `server` to the transport owned by your application.
```

For the CLI-owned stdio process, use the executable instead of creating an
embedded server:

```ts
import { runStdioServer } from "hevy-mcp";

await runStdioServer();
```

`createNodeMcpServer` is the side-effect-free embedding entry: it validates the
supplied key locally, but never reads environment variables, probes Hevy,
connects a transport, initializes telemetry, or installs process lifecycle
handlers. The CLI-only `runStdioServer` function owns those concerns.

<details>
<summary><strong>Use bunx instead</strong></summary>

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/):

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"hevy": {
			"command": "bunx",
			"args": ["hevy-mcp@latest"],
			"env": {
				"HEVY_API_KEY": "your-hevy-api-key"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Use Docker instead</strong></summary>

Official images support `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Keep stdin open with
`-i` because the container runs the stdio MCP server:

```bash
export HEVY_API_KEY=your-hevy-api-key
docker run -i --rm -e HEVY_API_KEY ghcr.io/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp:latest
```

For an MCP client, store the key in a protected environment file and configure
the client to launch Docker:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"hevy": {
			"command": "docker",
			"args": [
				"run",
				"-i",
				"--rm",
				"--env-file",
				"/absolute/path/to/hevy-mcp.env",
				"ghcr.io/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp:latest"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Pin an exact image tag such as `ghcr.io/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp:X.Y.Z` when you need
reproducible upgrades.

</details>

You can also add the npm server to supported clients with
[`add-mcp`](https://github.com/neon-solutions/add-mcp):

```bash
npx add-mcp hevy-mcp --env "HEVY_API_KEY=your-hevy-api-key"
```

### 3. Ask your first question

Try one of these after restarting or reconnecting your MCP client:

- “Give me a training summary for the last four weeks.”
- “What routines do I have saved on Hevy?”
- “Show my three most recent workouts.”
- “Find exercise templates containing squat.”
- “Which Hevy account is connected?”

Your assistant should ask for approval before mutation tools when the client
supports tool confirmations.

## How it works

```text
Hosted:  Your AI assistant  →  Streamable HTTP  →  Cloudflare Worker  →  Hevy API
Local:   Your AI assistant  →  MCP over stdio   →  local hevy-mcp     →  Hevy API
```

The hosted endpoint creates a fresh MCP server and Hevy client for each request.
It validates the supplied key with Hevy, keeps no shared user session, and does
not persist the key. The local server follows the same tool contract but runs on
your machine and receives the key through its child-process environment.

In either mode, read tools retrieve data; mutation tools create or replace data
only when your assistant calls them.

## Guided prompts

These server-provided MCP prompts coordinate common multi-step workflows:

| Prompt                        | Arguments                                  | Workflow                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `analyze-workout-progress`    | Optional `weeks` from 1-12; default `4`    | Calls `get-training-summary`, then analyzes workout activity and body-measurement trends from the returned evidence.   |
| `create-workout-from-routine` | Required `routine_id` and UTC `start_time` | Loads a routine, collects actual completed-set data and an end time, then creates a workout without inventing results. |

> [!NOTE]
> With MCP SDK v1.29.0, clients invoking `analyze-workout-progress` with its
> default value must send `arguments: {}`. Omitting the entire `arguments`
> object is rejected by that SDK version before the default is applied.

## Tools

`hevy-mcp` registers 22 tools. Read-only tools are safe for exploration; create
and update tools are exposed with MCP mutation annotations so compatible clients
can request confirmation.

| Category           | Tool                        | Description                                                                                                            |

| Exercise templates | `search-exercise-templates` | Search the full exercise catalog by title substring.                                                                   |
| Exercise templates | `create-exercise-template`  | Create a custom exercise template.                                                                                     |
| Exercise history   | `get-exercise-history`      | Get past performed sets for one exercise template.                                                                     |
| Body measurements  | `get-body-measurements`     | List dated body measurements.                                                                                          |
| Body measurements  | `get-body-measurement`      | Get the body measurement entry for one date.                                                                           |
| Body measurements  | `create-body-measurement`   | Create a dated body measurement.                                                                                       |
| Body measurements  | `update-body-measurement`   | Update the body measurement for an existing date.                                                                      |

`create-routine` requires a top-level `routine` envelope with a required `exercises` array; fields use snake_case at every level:

```json
{
	"routine": {
		"title": "Full Body A",
		"folder_id": 123,
		"notes": "First four exercises are the minimum viable workout",
		"exercises": [
			{
				"exercise_template_id": "30E293E3",
				"superset_id": null,
				"rest_seconds": 120,
				"notes": "Controlled active ROM",
				"sets": [
					{
						"type": "normal",
						"rep_range": {
							"start": 6,
							"end": 10
						}
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}
}
```

The Hevy API currently exposes no delete endpoints for workouts, routines,
routine folders, exercise templates, or body measurements, so there are no
corresponding delete tools.

## Hosted Cloudflare endpoint

The production MCP server is live at:

```text
https://mcp.hevy-mcp.dev/mcp
```

It is the quickest way to use `hevy-mcp`: there is nothing to install or keep
running locally, and it exposes the same 22 tools as the npm package and Docker
image.

The Cloudflare Worker uses stateless **Streamable HTTP** at `POST /mcp`.
Clients must send their Hevy API key as a fixed authorization header:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"hevy": {
			"url": "https://mcp.hevy-mcp.dev/mcp",
			"headers": {
				"Authorization": "Bearer your-hevy-api-key"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The bearer value is your Hevy API key, not an OAuth token. The Worker validates
the key with Hevy on each request, does not store it, and forwards it upstream
only as Hevy's required `api-key` header.

### OAuth for Claude.ai and other remote MCP clients

Workers deployed with an `OAUTH_KV` namespace binding (see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)) additionally expose a full OAuth 2.1
layer for clients that cannot send a fixed header, such as Claude.ai custom
connectors:

- RFC 8414 / RFC 9728 discovery metadata under `/.well-known/`
- Dynamic client registration (`/register`) and PKCE token exchange (`/token`)
- An `/authorize` page where you paste your Hevy API key once; the key is
  validated with Hevy and stored encrypted inside the OAuth grant

Add the Worker URL ending in `/mcp` as a Claude.ai custom connector and
complete the authorization flow in the browser. Direct
`Authorization: Bearer <hevy-api-key>` requests keep working unchanged — the
OAuth layer is purely additive — and rotating your Hevy API key invalidates
every OAuth grant created with it.

The endpoint does not expose legacy SSE or a `GET` event stream. Without the
opt-in OAuth layer, clients that require OAuth discovery, dynamic
registration, or token refresh are not compatible unless they can send the
fixed custom header above.

### Self-host the Worker

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to deploy the Cloudflare Worker for
self-hosted Streamable HTTP.

The local executable uses stdio by default. To opt into Streamable HTTP, run:

```bash
HEVY_API_KEY=your-hevy-api-key npx hevy-mcp --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
```

The MCP endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp`. For a specific bind host,
HTTP mode validates the Host header and configured port to protect against DNS
rebinding. Loopback is the default. Wildcard binds (`0.0.0.0` or `::`) accept
any hostname so they can be used behind Docker port mappings or a reverse
proxy; they require `HEVY_MCP_HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN` and rely on that separate
authentication token. Do not expose an unprotected shared Hevy account to the
public internet. For Docker HTTP mode, publish the port explicitly:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -e HEVY_API_KEY -e HEVY_MCP_HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN \
  ghcr.io/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp:latest --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

Wildcard binds are allowed only with the separate bearer token; publish the
container port deliberately and keep that token private.

### Cache behavior

`search-exercise-templates` and `hevy://exercise-templates` share a
server-scoped in-memory catalog cache:

- Entries live for five minutes, and the cache holds at most one catalog.
- Concurrent catalog requests share an in-flight fetch when possible.
- `search-exercise-templates` accepts `refresh: true` to invalidate the cache.
- Each hosted Worker request gets a fresh cache, preventing cross-key sharing.

### Local Node telemetry and privacy

The local Node package enables project telemetry by default. It is local Node
behavior only; the Cloudflare Worker does not import Node telemetry. Set
`HEVY_MCP_TELEMETRY=0` before startup or import to disable all project
telemetry. Only the literal value `0` opts out: an unset value, an empty value,
`1`, `false`, and every other value remain enabled. The master setting takes
precedence over `SENTRY_DSN` and packaged or runtime `OTEL_COLLECTOR_TOKEN`
credentials, so the disabled path creates no telemetry exporters or periodic
metric readers and makes no telemetry network requests. `SENTRY_DSN` remains a
Sentry-only setting; when telemetry is enabled, an empty value disables only
Sentry export.

When enabled, actionable errors are sent to the Sentry project configured by
`SENTRY_DSN`; Sentry performance tracing is disabled. Exception messages and
stacks are bounded and scrubbed before export. Set
`HEVY_MCP_TELEMETRY_DIAGNOSTICS=0` to keep structural traces and metrics while
suppressing those details. Traces and metrics continue to be sent to the
collector at
<https://otel.chrisdoc.dev/v1/traces> and
<https://otel.chrisdoc.dev/v1/metrics>, which forward to Honeycomb. Metrics
export every 30 seconds.

The API key is never exported and is not used to derive a user identity. A
per-failure diagnostic ID and OTel trace ID may be attached to actionable
errors for support correlation. Structured telemetry contains only bounded
service, release, transport, tool, outcome, error, count, retry, duration,
session, cache, workflow, API method, normalized endpoint, and status fields.

Exception messages and stacks are treated as diagnostic details: they are
length-limited, scrubbed for credentials, URLs, and local home paths, and
removed entirely when `HEVY_MCP_TELEMETRY_DIAGNOSTICS=0`. Prompts, tool
arguments, tool results, request bodies, API keys, raw identifiers/queries,
exact dates, workout/routine/folder/template/body-measurement content,
names/titles/descriptions/notes, measurement values, arbitrary client
metadata, and unnormalized endpoint paths remain prohibited.

## Security and mutations

- Keep `HEVY_API_KEY` out of source control, URLs, logs, and screenshots.
- Local clients provide the key through the child process environment.
- Hosted clients send the key only in the `Authorization: Bearer` header. The
  Worker validates each key with Hevy, does not store it, and sends it upstream
  only as Hevy's `api-key` header.
- Browser requests must come from an exact allowlisted origin. The default
  allowlist includes Claude.ai, ChatGPT, VS Code for the Web, and github.dev;
  self-hosted deployments can override it with `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
- Create operations can produce duplicates when retried. Update operations
  replace existing records. Review tool inputs and use client confirmations.

## Troubleshooting

- **The server does not appear:** restart or reconnect your MCP client after
  changing its configuration.
- **`npx` fails:** confirm that Node.js 20 or newer is installed, then run
  `npx -y hevy-mcp --version` in a terminal.
- **Codex cannot see the server:** run `codex mcp list`, then start a new Codex
  session after confirming the `hevy` entry exists.
- **Hevy API returns 401:** the key is invalid, expired, revoked, or
  misconfigured. Verify or create an active key at
  [Hevy's API settings](https://www.hevyapp.com/api), then restart the client.
- **Hosted authentication fails:** confirm the key belongs to a Hevy PRO
  account and is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <HEVY_API_KEY>`.
- **Local authentication fails:** confirm the key is active and available to the
  MCP child process as `HEVY_API_KEY`.
- **Need diagnostics:** set `HEVY_MCP_DEBUG=1`. Diagnostic output goes to stderr
  and does not interfere with MCP messages on stdout.
