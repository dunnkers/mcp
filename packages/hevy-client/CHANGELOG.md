## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- [#1094](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1094) [`16d359a`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/16d359a26a9435391915a3f31dd20a63f4d7e4c0) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Combine five retry-resilience and error-clarity fixes into one release:
  
  - Retry read operations once with a fresh timeout budget after a deadline,
    bounded by an overall operation deadline. Per-operation timeoutMs overrides
    are now supported. An explicit caller deadline remains authoritative —
    no deadline retry extends beyond it.
  - Give each retry attempt its own fresh per-attempt timeout window and add
    bounded crypto-random jitter to all retry backoff, reducing synchronized
    HTTP 429 retries.
  - Report caller-initiated request cancellation as a client cancellation
    instead of an ambiguous Hevy API cancellation.
  - Reject invalid empty routine exercise and set lists before API calls, and
    include sanitized Hevy validation details when routine mutations receive
    HTTP 400 responses.
  - Provide actionable guidance when creating a body measurement conflicts with
    an existing date.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- [#1057](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1057) [`139ae78`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/139ae78a3293ebe401a13ea88f3946f29848577e) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Export the generated workout and routine set schemas from the curated schemas entry point and pin the MCP input enum vocabularies (RPE, set type) to them with a contract test, so upstream enum changes surface at test time instead of drifting.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- [#848](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/848) [`11d55d2`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/11d55d238cfc4e874d470d798206c349fda4d9d0) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Add privacy-safe MCP session correlation and richer request lifecycle telemetry.

- [#848](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/848) [`11d55d2`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/11d55d238cfc4e874d470d798206c349fda4d9d0) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Add bounded, privacy-safe failure events and expected outcome classification.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#833](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/833) [`39d5896`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/39d589617b1a83ae36a97ce6b52aa89f022681e5) Thanks [@neontty](https://github.com/neontty)! - Fix get-routine failing for every routine: the Routine read schema typed each exercise's `rest_seconds` as a string, but the Hevy API returns an integer. Correct the OpenAPI spec (and regenerated client) to type it as an integer and align the get-routine output contract, matching the Post/Put routine request schemas. get-routines was unaffected because its compact projection omits `rest_seconds`.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#795](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/795) [`ba871dd`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/ba871dda0dd14e125332be1cc534814737579480) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Bound Hevy response fetching and body consumption with per-attempt timeouts.
