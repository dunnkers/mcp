## 0.2.9

### Patch Changes

- [#1094](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1094) [`16d359a`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/16d359a26a9435391915a3f31dd20a63f4d7e4c0) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Combine five retry-resilience and error-clarity fixes into one release:
  
  - Retry read operations once with a fresh timeout budget after a deadline,
    bounded by an overall operation deadline. Per-operation timeoutMs overrides
    are now supported. An explicit caller deadline remains authoritative —
    no deadline retry extends beyond it.
  - Give each retry attempt its own fresh per-attempt timeout window and add
    bounded crypto-random jitter to all retry backoff, reducing synchronized
    HTTP 429 retries.
  - Report caller-initiated request cancellation as a client cancellation
    instead of an ambiguous Hevy API cancellation.
  - Reject invalid empty routine exercise and set lists before API calls, and
    include sanitized Hevy validation details when routine mutations receive
    HTTP 400 responses.
  - Provide actionable guidance when creating a body measurement conflicts with
    an existing date.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- [#1078](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1078) [`9e86cb2`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/9e86cb269e5d1ceedf9eb0f0208559d288bb297f) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Guard `mergeAbortSignals` with an `AbortSignal.any` capability check and a manual composition fallback so self-hosted Node runtimes older than 20.3 no longer fail every tool dispatch with `TypeError: AbortSignal.any is not a function`.

- [#1083](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1083) [`a9cca6b`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/a9cca6bc167c7a296532d10d1a272851b43487a4) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - chore: switch the repository package manager from npm to pnpm 12. Internal workspace dependencies use the `workspace:*` protocol, scripts/workflows/docs were migrated, and the lockfile is now `pnpm-lock.yaml`. No runtime behavior change.

- [#1081](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1081) [`37ded34`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/37ded345d7ea1b8639bd0ebe373a76c38f22a94d) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - chore(deps): update `@sentry/node` to 10.72.0, `@types/node` to 26.4.0, and `zod` to 4.5.2 within existing semver ranges.

- [#1080](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1080) [`919ad8e`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/919ad8e5da1bcd45c817727bedb5d1daedb25988) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Test-only: strengthen tool output-schema assertions and replace Git-based changeset fixtures with pure filesystem fixtures.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- [#1074](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1074) [`65970a1`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/65970a1fc95f80b82e52e67cf45fd3481fdbcc45) Thanks [@manelpb](https://github.com/manelpb)! - Retry transient Hevy API key validation failures (e.g. HTTP 503 or 408; HTTP 429 is intentionally not retried, to avoid spending calls against the rate limit that caused the outage), log the upstream status/code when validation still fails, and cache successful validations for 15 minutes so a brief Hevy outage no longer turns into a 502 for a key that was just confirmed valid.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- [#1056](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1056) [`3a29218`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/3a29218d6b1d837eeecb5cb849396eee9f62e3e0) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Narrow the operations interface to the names consumers actually use; remove four dead exported predicates and stop re-exporting internal operation plumbing.

- [#1053](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1053) [`4556c13`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/4556c13e18fb7281788e86505b09985e1f061e62) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Export the safe-error diagnostic vocabulary (codes, methods, categories, stack sources) from core as its interface; the Worker adapter validates against the shared vocabulary instead of private copies. Folds the safe-error-diagnostic re-export into error-policy.

- [#1054](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1054) [`1b83866`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/1b83866030f004bc19ccb8ebc860828fc853957d) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Own the telemetry contract constants (user hash context, hash shape, argument-key allowlist) in core so the Node and Worker adapters cannot drift apart.

- [#1057](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1057) [`139ae78`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/139ae78a3293ebe401a13ea88f3946f29848577e) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Export the generated workout and routine set schemas from the curated schemas entry point and pin the MCP input enum vocabularies (RPE, set type) to them with a contract test, so upstream enum changes surface at test time instead of drifting.

- [#1051](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1051) [`2cd03b0`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/2cd03b09d8d59d19118a4af81ae568f34914441a) Thanks [@charliecreates](https://github.com/apps/charliecreates)! - Scan all reported training-summary pages so later workouts and body measurements are not hidden by older records on earlier pages, and apply the same fix to the `hevy` CLI summary export.

- [#1052](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1052) [`5c9a57a`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/5c9a57aead4e7b64d4dbfae7785742be26eaf196) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Split response-contracts into output-schemas and formatters modules with no behavior change; response contract wiring stays in response-contracts.

- [#1055](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1055) [`4f2b707`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/4f2b7074505948b3dfb6021f9e0e20fd971a66d6) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Give the workout is_private quirk one home in hevy-quirks; the runtime rule, user-facing error, and tool-description clauses all derive from the same constants so they cannot drift.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- [#1049](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1049) [`e7934bb`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/e7934bb0d01ef1bbb9915bbd1252998fa25c440a) Thanks [@jacksonpradolima](https://github.com/jacksonpradolima)! - Fix update-workout failing with Hevy API HTTP 500 when is_private is omitted.
  
  The upstream Hevy API requires `is_private` in PUT requests, but the GET endpoint does not return it. The tool description stated that omitted fields remain unchanged, but this was not true for `is_private` due to API contract mismatch.
  
  Changes:
  
  - Add validation in `update-workout` to require explicit `is_private` value, preventing the opaque transient-error from the API
  - Add `is_private` requirement to `replace-workout-exercises` schema and tool handler
  - Improve error message handling to preserve safe user-facing error messages while blocking sensitive information
  - Add regression test for metadata-only workout updates

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- [#1031](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1031) [`ae58ddd`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/ae58ddd420289d7fb53a84f02e5e01d021c61ab6) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Use endpoint-agnostic guidance for HTTP 409 conflicts so routine conflicts are not described as body measurement conflicts.

- [#1036](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1036) [`a9a7594`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/a9a75943e32656299fc0f523d0eed5848d8d64bc) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Improve the error guidance when updating a routine that no longer exists in Hevy.

- [#1045](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1045) [`cd46318`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/cd4631886e98119d548e16017bb12071c0bbc5dd) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Reduce per-request CPU in the Worker: memoize tool schema registration once per isolate, and preload the actual compact-JSON-Schema conversions at module scope so the first request only reads already-converted schemas. This eliminates the repeated conversion that caused intermittent `Worker exceeded CPU time limit` (503) responses.

- [#1042](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/1042) [`31bf76a`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/31bf76a8d6f6a5305de5637e359eae086677f9f7) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Adapt telemetry and Worker tracing fallbacks to the upgraded Cloudflare Workers types and Node type definitions.
