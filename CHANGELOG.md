## 3.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#700](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/700) [`e2f2610`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/e2f261071567be8d5ba009dc1d9df8d128c7a037) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Add privacy-safe MCP telemetry taxonomy, bounded tool outcomes, session compatibility signals, and dashboard guidance.

## 3.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#692](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/692) [`6b576ec`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/6b576ec10f7e47645475605dd272b7032b11c719) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Improve Sentry MCP tool-failure diagnostics by preserving tool context and grouping failures by their normalized error dimensions.

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#682](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/682) [`c979b6a`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/c979b6a1ce7eb11a91d63781828875f0bcde2fb3) Thanks [@planecore](https://github.com/planecore)! - Add an optional OAuth 2.1 layer to the Cloudflare Worker so remote MCP clients such as Claude.ai custom connectors can connect without a fixed Authorization header. When an `OAUTH_KV` namespace is bound, the Worker serves RFC 8414 / RFC 9728 discovery metadata, dynamic client registration, and PKCE token exchange, plus an `/authorize` page that validates the submitted Hevy API key against Hevy and stores it encrypted inside the OAuth grant. Without the binding, Worker behavior is unchanged, and direct Hevy-API-key bearer requests keep working in both modes.

### Patch Changes

  replacing the loose custom response interface, narrowing helper content to
  SDK `TextContent[]`, and ensuring JSON responses always emit string text.

- [#436](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/436) [`f1b6018`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/f1b601801ab5d8d8c8948d1cc102606781736fc7) Thanks [@charliecreates](https://github.com/apps/charliecreates)! - Add a shared bounded TTL async cache utility and migrate exercise template
  catalog caching in `search-exercise-templates` to use it. This keeps cache
  behavior consistent (TTL, LRU bound, refresh invalidation, and in-flight
  request de-duplication) and adds tests plus README documentation.

- [#463](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/463) [`d5df6ca`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/d5df6cac5db50fe0dbe6feadb0268e6d434604e5) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Fix commitlint failing on Mergify batch merge commits in the merge queue.

- [#434](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/434) [`59f95fe`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/59f95fe448bcb5cd38f253e62ae69439ece8762b) Thanks [@charliecreates](https://github.com/apps/charliecreates)! - Deprecate CLI API key arguments by warning on stderr whenever
  `--hevy-api-key=...`, `--hevyApiKey=...`, or `hevy-api-key=...` is used.
  Keep backward compatibility for those flags while documenting `HEVY_API_KEY`
  as the recommended and secure configuration path.

- [#474](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/474) [`12cf700`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/12cf70079ad52819820509fa7a2e3337e7e6c73a) Thanks [@chrisdoc](https://github.com/chrisdoc)! - Fix missing OTEL_COLLECTOR_TOKEN in the Release workflow build step.

  The Release workflow built the npm package without passing the
  OTEL_COLLECTOR_TOKEN secret, so the published package had an empty
  collector token. This caused the OTLP exporter to be skipped at
  runtime (the `if (collectorToken)` guard in telemetry.ts), meaning
  no traces or metrics were sent to the OTel Collector.

- [#439](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/439) [`ca182f6`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/ca182f60c6aa0aa24d75f3f5a74559f123d066b9) Thanks [@charliecreates](https://github.com/apps/charliecreates)! - Add mocked integration coverage with nock and run mocked integrations on every
  PR while keeping live integrations optional behind `HEVY_API_KEY`.

  exit before server startup, with unit test coverage for flag and default
  startup behavior.

- [#423](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/423) [`8dfb593`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/8dfb59326202bd0473bfeb3c26c413b6f8475cb4) Thanks [@charliecreates](https://github.com/apps/charliecreates)! - Map common Hevy API error statuses to clearer MCP error messages and keep

  OTel Collector (forwarding to Honeycomb and other backends).

  - New `src/utils/telemetry.ts` initializes OpenTelemetry with a custom
    tracer provider that has dual span processors: `SentrySpanProcessor`
    for Sentry (errors + traces) and `BatchSpanProcessor` with
    `OTLPTraceExporter` routed through our own OTel Collector, which
    forwards traces and metrics to Honeycomb and other backends.
  - New `src/utils/metrics.ts` defines metric instruments (counters and
    histograms) for tool invocations, errors, duration, API calls, API
    latency, stdio parse errors, and server startups.
  - Migrated all `Sentry.startSpan()` calls to the OpenTelemetry API
    (`tracer.startActiveSpan()`) for vendor-neutral span creation.
    Spans are still exported to Sentry via the `SentrySpanProcessor`.
  - Added axios interceptors to `hevyClientKubb.ts` for automatic HTTP
    tracing and metrics recording on every Hevy API call.
  - The collector endpoint and auth token are injected at build time
    from the `OTEL_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_COLLECTOR_TOKEN`
    GitHub secrets via `tsdown.config.ts` define. Traces and metrics
    are sent to the OTel Collector, which forwards them to Honeycomb
    and other observability backends.
  - Sentry remains the error monitoring backend (captureException,
    setUser, withScope, wrapMcpServerWithSentry).

## 1.25.17

### Patch Changes

- [#393](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/pull/393) [`a1ddf76`](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/a1ddf76c8a2c9c315920e52bebbbf40a1a355223) Thanks [@charliecreates](https://github.com/apps/charliecreates)! - Fix exercise template catalog caching so a failed in-flight fetch is not
  reused as a rejected promise and subsequent searches retry naturally.

### Bug Fixes

- preserve routine supersetId in read responses ([#375](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/issues/375)) ([9291ace](https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp/commit/9291acec0cba10bc79771b7b995de31af919e593))
